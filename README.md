empowering our clients to do what they do best - better.

### Project Planning

* Pivotal Tracker (our fave 💙)
* JIRA
* Trello for non-code related activities

### Communication

* We have worked with in-house and remote teams, and we have reached to the conclusion that our iterations are way faster 
when we are at the same office. It's also nice to talk about issues openly with your colleagues face to face, Skype calls 
with multiple people can be chaotic and non-productive.
* [Slack](https://slack.com/). All the repositories and deployment activities are notified to specific rooms allowing us 
to track who is doing what. We believe in transparency so our clients and us are on the same page anytime.
* [Line](https://line.me/en-US/). Used for internal and out-of-office communication. 

### For deployment/hosting

* Via CI/CD servers (Semaphore CI and Jenkins CI)
* [Mina](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina) in some cases e.g. Azure
* Digital Ocean. Our fave 💙 for self-managed servers. 
* Heroku. Our goto hosting provider for managed servers.
* AWS
* Azure
* Some git hooks for specific tasks like updating i18n files
